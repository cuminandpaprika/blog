      <description>Engineering projects which require maintainable code should always start with a team of 3 or more engineers.
Why such an arbitrary number, you might ask? Why can&amp;rsquo;t a single engineer write maintainable code? Perhaps your thoughts might lean towards peer-review for PRs, and arrive at the number 2. Two engineers should be enough to properly review.
So why is it important for software to be maintatainable?
