Engineers are in the business of turning ideas into reality. Just like a wizard forms an intent and channels the energies of the ether, an engineer uses the tools at their disposal, the keyboard, the programming language and the cloud platform to formulate and execute an idea.

First, you want to test that idea was a good one. First attempts at an idea should be quick and dirty. If you've crafted an implmenetation to perfection, you've taken too long to test your idea. The first thing you need to do is to test the idea. 

The next question comes when you've worked out, great, the idea was a good one. How do I keep this running and bringing whatever benefits (money, social good, value) to the world? Then comes the bulk of the work, in making an idea robust, durable and maintainable.

## Complexity
All systems are a function of their complexity. As complexity goes up, so does the speed of change of a system.

The success of an engineering team lies in their ability to test ideas quickly and then keep great ideas running for as long as the idea holds value in the world.
If we model it as a system

Inputs -> Engineering team -> Outputs

The inputs to a team include feedback from the users or customers.
The outputs are the systems we build and maintain.

So the key principles of an enginering team should be

- Speed
  - How quickly can we build something?
  - How quickly can we change something?
- Quality
  - How do we know that that the idea is a good one?
  - 

Programming languages constrain an engineer in how they can think about a problem and how they can express and solve a problem. Just like if how in some spoken languages, we have a myriad of words to express some things, but is anemic for expressing other ideas. The eskimo language has 20 differnt words to describe snow.
