There are two speeds at which Software Engineers need to develop code at. The right speed depends on the stage of company you are working at.

But before we get into that, we need to define what product market fit is.

Product Market Fit (PMF)

According to Wikipedia:

> Product-market fit, also known as product/market fit, is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand.

To rephase this, this means you've proven that customers will pay for what you are building.



Pre-product market fit

At this point, speed is everything. There are a million and one failed startups which have not found PMF. The objective of a startup is to achieve product-market-fit.

What do you not do here?

- Design highly scalable architecture
- Automate repetetive processes
- Refactor and clean up tech debt

The goal is to fail fast and to fail cheaply. Scope creep often comes in here but it's important to be ruthless and to keep the feature set for the MVP as minimal as possible.


Post Product Market Fit

Congrats, you've found PMF. Now you can build everything for real. You know the crappy MVP that's held together by scotchtape and hacky workarounds? You can now build it the "right way".
