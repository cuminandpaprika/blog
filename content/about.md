Hey, I'm Jack, a Software Engineer.

<br/>

I'm currently building fraud detection systems at [Mozn](https://www.mozn.sa/) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Alumni of University of Melbourne.

<br/>

I'm fascinated by software craftsmanship, design, cooking, late-night philosophy and cloudy things. Looking to find the perfect cup of coffee:coffee:.

<br/>

On a journey to learn new things, have fun and make the world better one day at a time.
