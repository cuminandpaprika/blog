Hey, I'm Jack, a Software Engineer.

<br/>

I'm currently building fraud detection systems at [Mozn](https://www.mozn.sa/) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Alumni of University of Melbourne.

<br/>

I’ve been building things ever since I can remember, from Lego Blocks as a 5 year old to Cities on Sim City 4 and most recently I’ve been building things with code. Mostly backend, mostly Go. 

<br/>

Throughout my life, I’ve built many things that bring me satisfaction, from helping launch a Cube Sat at Melbourne Space Program to mission-critical onboarding systems at Australia’s largest bank.

<br/>

I'm fascinated by software craftsmanship, design, cooking, engineering philosophy and cloudy things. Looking to find the perfect cup of coffee:coffee:.
